    ARRAYS
        WHAT ARE ARRAYS?
            AN ARRAY IS A CONTAINER OBJECT THAT HOLDS A FIXED NUMBER OF
            VALUES OF A SINGLE TYPE. THE LENGTH OF AN ARRAY IS ESTABLISHED
            WHEN THE ARRAY IS CREATED.

            I.E: ARRAYS ARE INVINSIBLE TABLES/MATRICES OF DATA


        WHAT ARE ARRAYS USED FOR?
            STORING DATA
            CONVENIENT TO RETRIEVE DATA
            PROCESS DATA
            INDICATORS
            
        STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAYS
            STATIC
                SIZE OF ARRAY IS FIXED DURING DECLARATION
                SIZE CANNOT BE CHANGED
                **MORE EFFICIENT FOR COMPUTATION

            DYNAMIC
                SIZE CAN BE ASSIGNED OVER AND OVER AFTER DECLARATION
                **LESS EFFICIENT FOR COMPUTATION

    CODE STRUCTURE OF INDICATORS
        CALCULATE THE INDICATOR VALUES
        INSERT VALUES INTO A BUFFER
            4 PARTS
                SETUP (IE: SETUP BUFFER)
                INIT
                DEINIT (IE: MOST OF THE TIME EMPTY)
                START
                    FIND THE NUMBER OF BARS TO FILL
                    CALCULATE INDICATOR VALUES
                    INSERT VALUES INTO BUFFER
