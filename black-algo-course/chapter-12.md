    WHAT IS STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE?
        THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RESULT OR RELATIONSHIP IS CAUSED BY SOMETHING
        OTHER THAN MERE RANDOM CHANCE. IN GENERAL, A 5% OR LOWER P-VALUE IS
        CONSIDERED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

    WHAT IS THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS?
        IN PROBABILITY THEORY, THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS IS A THEOREM THAT 
        DESCRIBES THE RESULT OF PERFORMING THE SAME EXPIRIMENT A LARGE NUMBER
        OF TIMES.

        THE AVERAGE OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROMA LARGE NUMBER OF TRIALS SHOULD 
        BE CLOSE TO THE EXPECTED VALUE, AND WILL TEND TO BECOME CLOSER AS MORE 
        TRIALS ARE PERFORMED. 

    IMPLICATIONS OF SS & LLN?
        SS:     WE WANT OUT BACKTEST RESULTS TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.
        LLN:    WE NEED A MIN NO OF TRADES FOR OUR BACKTEST RESULTS TO BE
                STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

    VISUALLY UNDERSTANDING LLN?
