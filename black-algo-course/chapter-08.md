
UNDERSTANDING POSITION SIZING BY FLIPPING A COIN

SIZING, THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS IN EACH POSITION
    IT JUST EXPLAINS THE BASIC OF POSITION SIZING THROUGH A HEADS OR TAILS
    BETTING METHOD.

    WITH THAT SAID, I FEEL THAT SIZING IS SUBJECTIVE BUT CORE PRINCIPLES ARE
        NEVER PLACE A POSITION THAT WILL BLOW YOUR ACCOUNT
        1% EQUITY IS A GOOD GENERALIZATION
        FOR SMALL ACCOUNTS, ITS HARDER TO FOLLOW THE %1 EQUITY RULE.

            FORMULA TO FIND OPTIMAL SIZING, MAXIMIZING UTILITIES

    OUR FIRST SIZING ALGO
        SIZING AMOUNT IN $      = (RISK*ACCOUNT BALANCE)/(STOP LOSS)
        
        SIZING AMOUNT IN LOTS   = SIZING AMOUUNT IN $/CONTRACT SIZE
                                = (RISK*ACCOUNT BALANCE)/(STOP LOSS*CONTRACT SIZE)
        
        I.E:
        ACCOUNT SIZE = $10,000
        SL           = 20 PIPS
        RISK         = 1%

        AMOUNT($)    =(1%*10,000)/20 PIPS
                     =(1%*10,000)/0.0020
                     =$50,000
    
    DERIVATION
        BACKWARD INDUCTION
            SIZING 1LOT: 1 PIP IS WORTH $10
            20PIPS = $200
            %1 RISK OF ACCOUNT BALANCE = $100

            THUS, WE SHOULD SIZE TO .5 LOTS

            0.5 = 100/(20*10)
            LOTS = (RISK*ACCOUNT)/((SL IN PIPS)*(PIP VALUE))
                 = (RISK*ACCOUNT)/(SL IN DECIMAL*CONTRACT SIZE)

        CORRELATION
            AMOUNT (LOTS) +VELY CORRELATED TO RISK
            AMOUNT (LOTS) +VELY CORRELATED TO ACCOUNT BALANCE
            
            AMOUNT (LOTS) -VELY CORRELATED TO STOP LOSS
            AMOUNT (LOTS) -VELY CORRELATED TO CONTRACT SIZE

                A +VELY CORRELATED TO B
                A = K&B (K IS CONSTANT)

                A-VE CORRELATED TO D
                A = M/D (M IS A CONSTANT)

                A = [(B*C)/(D*E)]*N (WHERE N IS A CONSTANT)
                AMT (LOTS) = (RISK*ACCOUNT)/(SL IN DECIMAL*CONTRACT SIZE)

CONCLUSION
    GOOD SIZING CANT MAKE A BAD EA/ALGO GOOD
    BAD SIZING CAN MAKE A GOOD EA/ALGO BAD
