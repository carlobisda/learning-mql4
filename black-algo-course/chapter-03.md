HOW TO CODE, THE THOUGHT PROCESS
    I KNOW HOW THE INDICATOR WORKS SO I DONT REALLY NEED IT
    BUT OVERALL, THIS IS A MA CROSSOVER EA.
    THOSE WHO KNOWS KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS

    ACTUAL CODING STRUCTURE
        if(a > b && c > d) {Long}
            laymen terms; if datapoint A is greater than datapoint B AND 
            datapoint c is greater than datapoint D then we enter a 
            long position

        if(e > f && g > h) {Short}
            laymen terms; see above

    NOTE** COURSE INDICATES THAT THIS IS A MOMENTUM STRATEGY BUT FOR ME,
    IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A MA CROSSOVER. MOMENTUM WOULD SUGGEST A STONG PUSH
    TO A CERTAIN DIRECTION. THIS EA SEEMS TO JUST FOLLOW THE FLOW.
